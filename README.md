# Flapping-wing-robot-project

This work covers "Development of Flapping Wing Robot and Vision-Based Obstacle Avoidance Strategy" and was collaborated by CNU (Chungnam National University) and UNIST (Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology)

A tailed flapping wing robot with a double wing pair named the CNUX Mini is developed, and the flight test video can be found at the link below.
